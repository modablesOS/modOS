## ModOS Development + Download Site

Hi, I'm modables. I'm a horrible developer, but I don't really care. I'm still going to make OSes.

Anyways, Here is my work.
Currently there is only one version of the OS which you can download below
[Download ModOS-V1.0.0.0](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
